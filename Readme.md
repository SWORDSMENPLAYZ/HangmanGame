This interactive Hangman project is on pygame with interactive buttons, a customizable game board and hangman figure which progresses as you get more guesses wrong. This basic project allows you to add words, and add more characters.

## Setup

#### Installation

Before installing pygame, you must check that Python is installed on your machine. To find out, open a command prompt (if you have Windows) or a terminal (if you have MacOS or Linux) and type this:

```sh
python --version
```

If a message such as "`Python 3.8.10`" appears, it means that Python is correctly installed. If an error message appears, it means that it is not installed yet. You must then go to the [official website](https://www.python.org/) and install it.

Once Python is installed, you have to perform a final check: you have to see if pip is installed. Generally, pip is pre-installed with Python but we are never sure. Same as for Python, type the following command:

```sh
pip --version
```

If a message such as "`pip 20.0.2 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.8)`" appears, you are ready to install the library. To install it, enter this command:

```sh
pip install pygame
```
